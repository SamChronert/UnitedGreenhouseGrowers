[Goal]
Build the Grants tab (TB-08) with comprehensive filters and table view, and scaffold the Tax Incentives tab (TB-09) marked as "Under Development".

[Actions for Replit Agent]
1. Create `src/components/tabs/GrantsTab.jsx`:
   - Add intro text: "Federal and state grant opportunities for greenhouse operations, infrastructure, and research. New to grants? Read our Grants 101 Guide."
   - Link "Grants 101 Guide" to `/blog/grants-101` or appropriate blog post
2. Implement grants table/list view with columns:
   - Grant Name (linked)
   - Agency
   - Amount Range ($min - $max)
   - Focus Areas (as tags)
   - Due Date (highlight if <30 days)
   - Status (Open/Closed/Rolling)
3. Create comprehensive filter panel:
   - Region/State multi-select
   - Organization type eligibility checkboxes
   - Focus area multi-select (Energy, Water, Technology, Research, etc.)
   - Amount range slider ($0 - $10M+)
   - Due date range picker
   - "Hide expired" toggle
4. Add seed data for 15-20 grants:
   ```
   {
     type: 'grants',
     title: 'USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant',
     data: {
       agency: 'USDA',
       amountMin: 50000,
       amountMax: 500000,
       focusAreas: ['Research', 'Marketing', 'Food Safety'],
       eligibility: {
         orgTypes: ['Non-profit', 'University', 'Government'],
         regions: ['All US States']
       },
       rfpDueDate: '2024-03-15',
       applyUrls: {
         grantsGov: 'https://grants.gov/...',
         program: 'https://usda.gov/...'
       }
     }
   }
   ```
5. Create `src/components/tabs/TaxIncentivesTab.jsx`:
   - Display "Under Development" banner with icon
   - Add placeholder text: "We're currently gathering and verifying tax incentive information for greenhouse operations. Check back soon!"
   - Include empty table structure for future use
   - Add "Notify me when available" email signup (if email service exists)
6. Implement table features:
   - Sortable columns (click header to sort)
   - Sticky header on scroll
   - Row hover highlighting
   - Mobile-responsive (cards on small screens)
7. Add export functionality:
   - "Export to CSV" button for current filtered results
   - Include all visible columns in export

[Checks & Tests]
- Navigate to Grants tab and verify table loads with data
- Test all filters and combinations (region + amount + focus area)
- Verify due date highlighting for upcoming deadlines
- Test sorting by clicking column headers
- Check Grants 101 link navigates correctly
- Test CSV export with filtered data
- Navigate to Tax Incentives tab and verify "Under Development" message
- Test mobile view: table should convert to cards
- Show me filtered results with amount range $100k-$1M
- Show me the exported CSV content for 3 grants

[Commit/PR]
Commit message: "feat: implement Grants and Tax Incentives tabs

- Add Grants table with comprehensive filtering
- Include amount ranges, due dates, and eligibility
- Add CSV export for filtered results
- Scaffold Tax Incentives with 'Under Development' flag"

[Stop Condition]
PASS: Grants table displays with working filters, sorting, and export. Tax Incentives shows placeholder.
FAIL: If filters don't combine properly, check query logic. If export fails, verify CSV generation.
