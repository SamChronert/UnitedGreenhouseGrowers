Use **Extended Thinking** and the **High-Power Model**.  
First outline your plan and wait for my “Approved – implement” before making any code changes.

Goal
=====
Add a **Member Type** selector to /register so users choose:
  • “Grower Member”  → sees full grower questionnaire  
  • “General Member” → sees basic form only

Conditional form logic
----------------------
* Member Type selection controls which inputs are rendered (React state is fine).  
* Switching the type instantly updates the form without page reload.  
* Grower-specific dropdowns include **“N/A”** as the last option.

Fields for **General Member**
-----------------------------
• Full Name (required)  
• Phone Number (required)  
• Email Address (required)  
• State (required)  
• Employer/Company (optional)  
• Job Title (optional)  
• Username (required)  
• Password (required, ≥12 chars)

Fields for **Grower Member** *(all required unless noted, dropdowns include “N/A”)*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Full Name  
• Phone Number  
• Email Address  
• State  
• County (required)  
• Employer/Company (optional)  
• Job Title (optional)  
• Username  
• Password  
• **Greenhouse Role** – radio:  
    ○ I own / manage this greenhouse  
    ○ I work at this greenhouse  
• **Crop Types Grown** – multi-select (max 8)  
    Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Leafy greens, Herbs, Strawberries, Peppers, Flowers/ornamentals, **Other**, **N/A**  
    ▸ If “Other” selected, show free-text `otherCrop` field (required)  
• **Greenhouse Size** – dropdown + N/A  
    Under 500 ft²; 500–2,000 ft²; 2,001–10,000 ft²; 10,001–43,560 ft²;  
    43,560–87,119 ft²; 87,120–217,799 ft²; Over 217,800 ft²; N/A  
• **Production Method** – Soil-based; Hydroponics; **N/A**  
• **Supplemental Lighting** – Yes; No; Planning to add; **N/A**  
• **Climate-Control Type** –  
    Passive High Tunnel; Naturally Ventilated; Mechanically Ventilated;  
    Evaporative-Cooled (Fan-and-Pad); Fog/Misting-Cooled; Semi-Closed;  
    Fully Closed / HVAC-Controlled; Other / Not Listed; **N/A**

Back-end & database tasks
=========================
1. Add `memberType` ("grower" | "general") to each record.  
2. Keep existing members as `"grower"` for backward compatibility.  
3. Add/ensure nullable keys: `county`, `role`, `cropTypes` (array),
   `otherCrop`, `ghSize`, `productionMethod`, `suppLighting`, `climateControl`.  
4. Registration endpoint must:  
   • Validate Grower vs General requirements.  
   • Enforce “Other” crop text when selected.  
   • Accept “N/A” as valid grower answers where provided.  
5. Write a migration script (if needed) to set new keys to null for existing users.  
6. No breaking changes to login or dashboards.

Front-end tasks
===============
* Update form UI with Member Type selector at top.  
* Conditionally render sections; preserve styling & responsiveness.  
* Real-time validation & inline error messages.  
* Preserve existing accessibility (labels, aria attributes).

Deliverables
============
1. **Plan summary** (files to modify/add, edge cases, test strategy).  
2. After approval, implement changes and create checkpoint **“member-type-conditional-registration”**.  
3. Provide a manual test checklist covering:  
   – New user (Grower), missing required field → error displayed  
   – New user (Grower), selects “Other” crop → prompted for text  
   – New user (General) sees only basic fields  
   – Existing users can still log in  

Await my reply **“Approved – implement”** before coding.
