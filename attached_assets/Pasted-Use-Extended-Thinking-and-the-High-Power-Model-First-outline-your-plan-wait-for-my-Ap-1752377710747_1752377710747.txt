Use **Extended Thinking** and the **High-Power Model**.  
First outline your plan; wait for my **“Approved – implement”** before coding.

================================================================
GOAL – Forum & Navigation Tweaks
================================================================
1️⃣ **Forum Page**  
   • Remove the **County** filter entirely (keep State & Category).  
   • Update dashboard-widget subtitle on Member Tools **and** Forum page header:  
     “Connect with fellow growers, share knowledge, organize bulk ordering.”

2️⃣ **Dashboard dropdown → add hubs**  
   • In the top-nav **Dashboard** dropdown, list items in this exact order:  
     1. Overview  
     2. Profile  
     3. Resource Library  
     4. Member Forum  
     5. Find a Grower  
     6. Farm Assessment  
     7. Sales Hub  
     8. Product Hub  

Front-end tasks
----------------
`client/src/pages/Forum.tsx`  
  – Remove County dropdown + logic.  
  – Adjust State filter to no longer cascade to County.  
  – Update header subtitle text.

`client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (Member Tools widget array)  
  – Change Member Forum description to new text.

`client/src/components/NavDashboardDropdown.tsx` (or equivalent layout/nav file)  
  – Re-order dropdown items and add **Sales Hub** & **Product Hub** links pointing to `/dashboard/saleshub` and `/dashboard/producthub`.

Back-end
--------
None (filters handled client-side; API already supports state/category).

Deliverables
------------
1. **Plan summary** (files, steps) — await approval.  
2. After approval, implement; commit checkpoint **“forum-nav-tweaks”**.  
3. Manual test checklist:  
   ▸ Forum page shows State + Category filters only.  
   ▸ Selecting State filters posts correctly.  
   ▸ Member Forum widget & page subtitle updated.  
   ▸ Dashboard dropdown shows eight items in specified order, links work.
