Hi Replit Agent — I’d like to add a new feature to the member dashboard of my UGGA site that allows growers to submit their real-world challenges in plain language, and gives the admin team tools to visualize and act on those submissions.

Please build the following functionality:

🌱 Grower-Facing Feature: “Submit a Challenge”
In the member dashboard, add a new section called “Share Your Challenge” or “What’s Hard on Your Farm?”

This should include:

A large free-text input (textarea) where growers can describe:

Operational challenges they’re facing

Areas where they need better support, knowledge, or policy changes

Suggestions or observations about what’s missing in research or technology

An optional category dropdown to tag the type of issue (e.g. irrigation, disease, labor, economics, policy, etc.)

A submit button — after submission, show a confirmation message (e.g., “Thanks for sharing — your insight helps shape what we build next.”)

Submissions should be saved to the database and linked to the user’s ID

Users should be able to submit more than once, but should not be able to view or edit others’ submissions

📊 Admin Dashboard Feature: “Grower Challenges Insights”
Create a new section of the admin dashboard to help synthesize and act on these submissions.

This admin-only view should include:

Submission List View

Table with timestamp, member ID (or name/email), category (if provided), and submission text

Sortable by date or category

Option to export to CSV

Visualization Panel

Show a chart or dashboard that quantifies:

Most frequently mentioned categories

Submission volume over time

Optionally include basic keyword clustering or tag cloud if you can process common themes

Admin Notes or Flagging

Ability for admins to mark submissions as “Reviewed,” “Important,” or “Needs Follow-Up”

These flags should be saved to the database for internal use

🔐 Permissions & Access
Only admins can access the insights dashboard

Grower submissions are not publicly visible, but admins can view them all

🗃️ Database Notes
Please create a table like grower_challenges with fields such as:

id (UUID)

user_id

category (optional string or enum)

description (text)

created_at

admin_flag (optional string: “reviewed”, “important”, etc.)

This feature will help the association understand where growers are struggling and guide advocacy, research, and policy decisions.

Let me know if you need clarification or want feedback on the UX! Thanks!
