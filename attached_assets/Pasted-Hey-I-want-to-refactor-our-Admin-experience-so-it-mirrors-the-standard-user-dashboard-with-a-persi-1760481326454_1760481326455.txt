Hey! I want to refactor our Admin experience so it mirrors the standard user dashboard, with a persistent left sidebar and nested pages for each admin tool.
What I want (high level)
* Create a separate Admin Dashboard (own layout + persistent left sidebar) that feels like the member dashboard.
* All Admin Tools live inside this Admin Dashboard as nested routes/pages (no more ejecting to standalone pages).
* Admins can toggle between the Member Dashboard and the Admin Dashboard via the left sidebar.
* Update navbar + dropdown so “Admin Dashboard” sends admins to the new dashboard root (not to a one-off tools page).
* Review and fix routing so URLs are clean, predictable, and backward-compatible (redirects where needed).
Behavior & UX
* When an Admin is logged in:
    * Navbar: “Admin Dashboard” opens /admin (new admin dashboard home).
    * Sidebar (Admin): Always visible across admin tool pages; shows links for all tools.
    * Admin Home (/admin): Replicates the current “Admin Tools” tile grid (cards/links), but now it’s the dashboard home, not a dead-end page.
    * Tool Pages: Open within the admin dashboard layout (sidebar stays). Examples:
        * /admin/resources
        * /admin/blog
        * /admin/members
        * /admin/feedback
        * /admin/analytics
        * /admin/farm-roadmap
        * /admin/ai-agent
* Toggle between dashboards:
    * Add a sidebar item (or segmented control) to jump between Member Dashboard (/dashboard) and Admin Dashboard (/admin).
* Keep styling consistent with the current dashboard system (cards, icons, spacing).
Routing & Access (auto-detect framework and apply best practice)
* Introduce nested admin routes under /admin with a shared AdminLayout (left sidebar + top header if needed).
* Add role guard for all /admin/** routes: only users with role Admin (or admin flag) can access.
* Redirects from old admin-tool URLs to new ones (301 or in-app redirects). Examples (adjust to match current paths):
    * /dashboard/admin or /admin-tools → /admin
    * /admin/resources* → /admin/resources* (ensure nested path consistency)
* Ensure any deep links still work.
* Remove Navbar drop-down and instead have the Navbar navigate to the admin dashboard home
Sidebar (Admin)
* Sections/links (use current naming & icons):
    * Admin Home
    * Resource Management
    * Blog Management
    * Member Management
    * Feedback
    * Platform Analytics
    * Farm Roadmap Manager
    * AI Agent Manager
    * (Divider) Switch to Member Dashboard
* Show active states, keyboard focus states, and collapse on mobile.
URL plan (propose & implement)
* /admin → Admin Home (cards)
* /admin/resources → Resource Management
* /admin/blog → Blog Management
* /admin/members → Member Management
* /admin/challenges → Feedback
* /admin/analytics → Platform Analytics
* /admin/farm-roadmap → Farm Roadmap Manager
* /admin/ai-agent → AI Agent Manager
* Keep /dashboard/** for member area. Provide a clean toggle between /dashboard and /admin.
Keep/Reuse
* Reuse existing admin tool pages/components; just wrap them in the new AdminLayout so the sidebar stays.
* Don’t break existing API calls or data models.
* Preserve current card grid from “Admin Tools” page; move it to /admin and tidy spacing/typography.
Error/Edge
* If a non-admin hits /admin/**, show a 403 screen with a safe link back to /dashboard.
* Handle old bookmarks via redirects.
* Ensure mobile works (sidebar collapses into a drawer).
Acceptance checklist
* /admin exists with a persistent sidebar and card grid home.
* All admin tools render inside /admin/** and keep the sidebar visible.
* Navbar “Admin Dashboard” goes to /admin.
* Sidebar includes a toggle link to /dashboard; member dashboard includes a link back to /admin (for admins).
* Old admin URLs redirect to the new nested routes.
* Role-guard enforced; 403 for non-admins.
* Mobile/desktop responsive; no layout jumps.
* No regressions in existing member dashboard.
Deliverables (please reply with)
* List of files created/updated (layouts, routes, components).
* Routing map (old → new) and redirect rules implemented.
* Screenshots/preview links: Admin Home, one tool page, 403 screen, mobile sidebar.
* Brief notes on any assumptions made and where to change menu items in the future.
If anything is ambiguous, choose the simplest approach that matches our current dashboard patterns and keeps URLs clean and consistent
