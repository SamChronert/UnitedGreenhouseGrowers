The Resource Library page is now completely blank - nothing is rendering at
   all. The routing structure isn't working. Looking at the URL in the
  screenshot (/dashboard/resources/tools-templates/list), the routes aren't
  matching properly.

  The issue is likely that:
  1. The ResourcesRouter component isn't being rendered at all
  2. Or the Switch/Route components from Wouter aren't matching the paths
  correctly

  Let's debug and fix this:

  1. First, add debug logging to ResourcesRouter to see if it's even being
  rendered:

  export default function ResourcesRouter() {
    console.log('ResourcesRouter is rendering');
    const [location] = useLocation();
    console.log('Current location:', location);

    // ... rest of component

  2. Check the route in DashboardWrapper.tsx - make sure it's:
  <Route path="/dashboard/resources/:rest*">
    {() => {
      console.log('Resource route matched');
      return <ResourcesRouter />;
    }}
  </Route>

  3. Wouter doesn't use Switch - it uses nested Routes differently. Fix the
  ResourcesRouter to use Wouter's pattern:

  import { Route, useLocation, useRoute } from "wouter";

  export default function ResourcesRouter() {
    const [location, navigate] = useLocation();

    // Parse the current path
    const basePath = '/dashboard/resources';
    const relativePath = location.replace(basePath, '');

    console.log('ResourcesRouter - location:', location);
    console.log('ResourcesRouter - relativePath:', relativePath);

    // Simple routing based on the path
    if (relativePath.startsWith('/tools-templates')) {
      const parts = relativePath.split('/');
      const viewMode = parts[2] || 'list';
      const subTab = parts[3] || 'tools';
      return <ToolsTemplatesTab viewMode={viewMode} subTab={subTab} />;
    }

    if (relativePath.startsWith('/universities')) {
      const parts = relativePath.split('/');
      const viewMode = parts[2] || 'grid';
      return <UniversitiesTab viewMode={viewMode} />;
    }

    // ... continue for other tabs

    // Default - redirect to tools-templates
    navigate('/dashboard/resources/tools-templates/list');
    return null;
  }

  4. Alternative simpler fix - go back to URL parameters but fix the 
  re-rendering issue:

  If the routing approach is too complex, let's revert to the original
  structure but force re-renders properly:

  // In each tab component, add a key based on viewMode to force re-render
  export default function UniversitiesTab({ onAnalyticsEvent }: 
  UniversitiesTabProps) {
    const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useParamState('view', 'map');

    // Force component to re-render when viewMode changes
    const [, forceUpdate] = useState({});

    useEffect(() => {
      forceUpdate({});
    }, [viewMode]);

    // ... rest of component

    return (
      <div key={viewMode}> {/* Add key here to force re-render */}
        {/* ... rest of JSX */}
      </div>
    );
  }

  5. Quick fix to just get it working:

  Revert to the original Resources.tsx structure but add proper state
  management:

  // In Resources.tsx
  export default function Resources() {
    const [location] = useLocation();
    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(location.split('?')[1] || '');

    // Force re-render on URL change
    const [renderKey, setRenderKey] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
      setRenderKey(prev => prev + 1);
    }, [location]);

    const activeTab = urlParams.get('tab') || 'tools-templates';

    return (
      <div key={renderKey}> {/* Force re-render with key */}
        {/* Original Resources.tsx content */}
      </div>
    );
  }

  Please check the console logs first to see what's actually being rendered.
  If ResourcesRouter isn't even being called, the route isn't matching. If it
   is being called but nothing renders, then the internal routing logic is
  wrong.

  The blank page means React isn't rendering anything, which is usually a
  routing mismatch or an error in the component that's preventing render.
