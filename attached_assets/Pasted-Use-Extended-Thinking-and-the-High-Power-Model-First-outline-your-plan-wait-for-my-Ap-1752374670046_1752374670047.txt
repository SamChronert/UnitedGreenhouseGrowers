Use **Extended Thinking** and the **High-Power Model**.  
First outline your plan; wait for my **“Approved – implement”** before changing code.

================================================================
GOAL
================================================================
1️⃣ Update existing widget copy  
2️⃣ Add **Sales Hub** & **Product Hub** (members-only)  
3️⃣ Re-order the Member Tools grid  
4️⃣ Add **“In Development”** badge + banner to specified widgets/pages  

----------------------------------------------------------------
A. Widget text changes
----------------------------------------------------------------
• **Farm Assessment** →  
  “Respond to the prompts to determine which areas of your farm to work on to improve yield and profitability for your operation.”

• **Resource Library** →  
  “Browse curated grower resources — find organizations near you, tax incentives and rebates, upcoming events, and more.”

• **Member Forum** →  
  “Connect with fellow growers to share knowledge and organize bulk ordering.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
B. New widgets, pages, and starter databases
----------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Sales Hub
* **Widget**  
  – Icon: map-pin / store  
  – Badge: orange **In Development** label on card  
  – Grid link → `/dashboard/saleshub`

* **Page `/dashboard/saleshub`**  
  – Auth-protected (same guard as other dashboard pages)  
  – Banner at top: **“Sales Hub – In Development”**  
  – Placeholder UI: interactive US map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles)  
  – Filter UI: dropdowns for **State** and **Category**

* **Starter DB table** `buyers_distributors`
  ```yaml
  id:           uuid  # PK
  name:         string
  state:        string  # 2-letter
  county:       string  # optional
  categories:   string[]  # e.g. ["wholesale","CSA","retail"]
  contactEmail: string
  phone:        string   # optional
  websiteUrl:   string   # optional
2. Product Hub
Widget
– Icon: shopping-bag / package
– Badge: In Development
– Grid link → /dashboard/producthub

Page /dashboard/producthub
– Auth-protected
– Banner: “Product Hub – In Development”
– Intro copy:

“Let us know if you want your product listed here!
Vendors must provide testimonials from two growers (with contact info) that can be seen by grower members.”
– Search bar + category filter (placeholder)

Starter DB table products

yaml
Copy
Edit
id:            uuid  # PK
productName:   string
category:      string
vendorName:    string
vendorEmail:   string
description:   string
testimonials:  # array of references
  - growerName:  string
    growerEmail: string
    quote:       string
C. Member Tools grid order
Row 1 → Resource Library • Member Forum • Find a Grower
Row 2 → Farm Assessment • Sales Hub • Product Hub • Member Profile

All widget cards share the existing style (white card, icon circle, hover ring, etc.).

D. “In Development” badge logic
• Widgets to show badge: Find a Grower, Farm Assessment, Resource Library, Sales Hub, Product Hub
• Each linked page (/dashboard/...) should render a dismissible top-banner with the same label.

Front-end tasks
client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
– Update text on existing widgets
– Add SalesHubWidget & ProductHubWidget
– Re-order grid per spec
– Add reusable InDevelopmentBadge component

client/src/pages/SalesHubPage.tsx
client/src/pages/ProductHubPage.tsx
– Scaffold pages with banner, placeholder UI, auth guard

Global styles / components
– Icons, badge component, Leaflet map wrapper

Back-end / DB
• Create / migrate buyers_distributors and products tables (Replit DB or Drizzle).
• Seed with 1-2 dummy rows for demo if helpful.

Deliverables
Plan summary (file list, DB schema, routing) — await approval.

After approval, implement; commit checkpoint “sales-product-hub-widgets”.

Manual test checklist:
▸ Widget texts updated
▸ Grid order matches spec
▸ All five specified widgets show badge + banner
▸ /dashboard/saleshub & /dashboard/producthub behind auth and render placeholder UIs
▸ Map loads with sample pin(s); search bar visible on Product Hub
▸ DB tables created

Await my “Approved – implement” before coding.
