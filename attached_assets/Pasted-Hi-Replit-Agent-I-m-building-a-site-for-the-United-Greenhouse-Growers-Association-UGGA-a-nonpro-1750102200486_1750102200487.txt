Hi Replit Agent — I’m building a site for the United Greenhouse Growers Association (UGGA), a nonprofit association that’s just getting started.

Please update the content and site experience across the homepage, about page, resources page, navbar, and blog to reflect the following voice, purpose, and sample language.

🌱 Mission & Purpose:
UGGA is a nonprofit, grower-first network in its pilot phase.
We exist to help greenhouse growers connect, share knowledge, and have a stronger voice in research and innovation.

We’re trying to solve a real problem: fragmentation. Growers are isolated. Research rarely makes it to the farm. Technology is everywhere but often untested. Growers are solving the same problems in silos.

UGGA wants to change that — together.

Please make that message clear throughout the site. We’re not selling software or AI — we’re building something with growers, not for them. Use friendly, conversational, plainspoken language that farmers and operators will relate to.

🧭 Goals for the Website Content:
Make it clear that:

The site and association are in early development.

We’re actively inviting growers to join the pilot and help shape the tools and resources we build.

Membership includes access to a dashboard that we’re co-designing with members — it will include:

Tools for making decisions on greenhouse improvements

A curated resource library (peer-reviewed + grower-approved)

A way to connect with fellow growers to share questions and answers

We need feedback to prioritize what gets built.

UGGA will help amplify the voice of growers to researchers, universities, and lobbying groups.

💬 Sample Taglines & Language (feel free to use or adapt):
Primary Tagline:

Connecting growers, sharing knowledge, strengthening greenhouses.

Status Banner / Development Notice:

🚧 UGGA is a nonprofit in its early stages. Join the pilot group and help shape the tools you need.

Home Page Welcome Message (sample):

UGGA is a new nonprofit network where greenhouse growers across the country can connect, share trusted resources, and help each other navigate a changing industry. We’re just getting started — and we want your input to make this association truly helpful.

Join CTA (sample):

Become a founding member and help shape a network built by growers, for growers.

About Page Copy (sample):

United Greenhouse Growers Association is a nonprofit forming to connect greenhouse growers across the U.S., share vetted knowledge, and give growers a stronger voice in research and policy. Our founding members, Sam Chronert and Dr. Melanie Yelton, started UGGA because they saw the same gap from both sides: growers tackling problems alone, and researchers unsure how to help. We’re here to close that gap — but we need your help to do it.

Resources Page Preview Text (sample):

We’re building a grower-reviewed resource library of guides, case studies, and extension bulletins — everything from irrigation best practices to supplier insights. Founding members will help decide what gets included, reviewed, and prioritized.

Navbar Banner / Ribbon (sample):

🚧 UGGA is in beta — growers wanted to shape the future!

👤 Founding Members
Please add a section (on the About page or footer) that highlights:

Sam Chronert — commercial greenhouse grower who has seen firsthand how helpful it is to connect with other growers facing the same challenges.

Dr. Melanie Yelton — long-time industry professional and researcher who wants to help give growers a stronger voice in academic and innovation circles.

📝 Blog Post
Please include one blog post to start — it should talk about the fragmentation in the greenhouse industry: research is scattered, growers are siloed, and tech is over-marketed but under-explained. The post should explain how UGGA is an effort to unify growers and give them a place to collaborate and be heard.

Suggested title:

"Fragmented Yet Full of Potential: A Call to Greenhouse Growers"

Suggested tone: warm, honest, not corporate.

✨ Design Preferences
Let the theme feel natural, clean, and non-corporate.

Avoid highlighting or naming “AI” directly — tools may use it under the hood, but we don’t want to sound flashy or overly tech-forward.

This is for real people who farm. Keep the tone honest, grounded, and helpful.

Emphasize community, usefulness, and grower empowerment.

Thanks! Please go ahead and make those updates. Once it’s applied, I’d be happy to give feedback or iterate further.
