Use **Extended Thinking** and **High-Power Model**.  
First outline your plan; wait for my “Approved – implement” before editing code.

Tweaks requested
================
1. **Member Type radio labels** – change to exactly:  
   • “Grower Member”  
   • “General Member”

2. **Grower form** – remove Job Title field entirely.

3. **Greenhouse Size dropdown labels** (include acreage > 1 acre):  
   • Under 500 ft²  
   • 500 – 2 000 ft²  
   • 2 001 – 10 000 ft²  
   • 10 001 – 43 560 ft² (≈ 1 acre)  
   • 43 560 – 87 119 ft² (1 – 2 acres)  
   • 87 120 – 217 799 ft² (2 – 5 acres)  
   • Over 217 800 ft² (> 5 acres)  
   ▸ Include **“N/A”** as final option (as before).

4. **Climate-Control Type** – convert to **multi-select**.  
   • User must select **at least one**.  
   • If **“N/A”** is chosen, automatically deselect (disable) all other options and treat “N/A” as the single value.

5. **Farm Type dropdown** (Grower only) – keep existing list:  
   Vegetable, Flower, Herb, Mixed, Nursery, Fruit, Other → if “Other”, show free-text `otherFarmType`.

6. **Field order**  
   • **Grower Member:**  
     Full Name → Email → Phone Number → State → County → Employer/Company → Greenhouse Role → Greenhouse Size → Farm Type → Crop Types Grown → Production Method → Climate-Control Type → Supplemental Lighting → Username → Password  
   • **General Member:**  
     Full Name → Email → Phone Number → State → Employer/Company → Job Title → Username → Password

Validation & UX
---------------
* Grower dropdowns still carry **“N/A”** as final option (except Climate-Control which is multiselect with special N/A logic).  
* Multi-select Crop Types (max 8) and new multi-select Climate-Control obey “at least one” rule.  
* Switching Member Type clears values for hidden fields.  
* Keep real-time validation messages and existing responsive design.

Back-end updates
----------------
* No schema changes beyond prior v1 work. Only ensure new multiselect Climate-Control field stores **array of strings**.  
* Adjust validation: Climate-Control array must contain at least one value, and if it contains “N/A” it must be the **only** value.

Deliverables
============
1. **Plan summary** (files, steps, edge cases) — await approval.  
2. After approval, implement; commit checkpoint **“registration-tweaks-v2”**.  
3. Provide updated manual-test checklist (both member types, multiselect logic, N/A behavior).

Await my reply **“Approved – implement”** before coding.
