Hi Replit Agent – I’d like to implement several improvements to the UGGA site. Please help with the following updates and new features:

🧭 1. Navigation Bar Redesign (Dynamic Based on User Role)
Please update the top navigation bar so it’s cleaner and grouped by role:

When a logged-in member views the site:

The nav bar should include “Dashboard” as a top-level item.

All member pages (e.g. Profile, Resources, Assessments, Find-a-Grower, etc.) should be shown in a dropdown menu under “Dashboard” — rather than listed individually in the nav bar.

When an admin is logged in:

Add a top-level item called “Admin Dashboard.”

All admin-specific pages (e.g. blog editor, member insights, grower challenges, farm assessment training) should be grouped under this in a dropdown menu.

Make the navigation dynamic based on whether the user is logged in and their role (MEMBER vs ADMIN).

💬 2. Member Forum Feature (with Smart Search & Media Upload)
Create a new Forum section where members can post and comment. This should include:

A public forum board where:

Members can make posts with titles, text, and optional image or file uploads

Other members can comment on posts

Posts and comments are visible to all logged-in members

A search function that allows members to search for topics or questions — not just by exact keywords, but by semantic meaning.

Please implement this as:

Each forum post is automatically tagged with keywords or topic labels using AI (e.g. OpenAI Embeddings or similar)

The search bar should return semantically relevant posts, even if the user doesn’t type in the exact matching words

Example: If someone posts about “humidity control in propagation,” the search should return that post if another user types “damp seedlings” or “wet leaves nursery.”

🧪 3. Farm Assessment Tool – Upload Support + Admin Training Interface
Please enhance the existing Farm Assessment Tool with the following features:

For Members:
When submitting an assessment, members should be able to upload images and files (e.g. photos of their grow space, nutrient data, equipment specs)

These uploads should be tied to the user’s submission so they can be analyzed as part of their assessment

For Admins:
Add a new page in the Admin Dashboard called “Farm Assessment Trainer” or similar

On this page, admins should be able to:

Add context to the Farm Assessment system by typing notes or uploading files/images

These admin submissions should go into a database or vector store the Farm Assessment tool can use for reference when generating feedback or recommendations

This lets us "teach" the tool how to give better, more relevant assessments over time

The goal is for the Farm Assessment system to continuously improve based on real examples and expert content.

Let me know if you need clarification on any part of this. Once these features are in place, I’d be happy to test and provide feedback. Thanks!
