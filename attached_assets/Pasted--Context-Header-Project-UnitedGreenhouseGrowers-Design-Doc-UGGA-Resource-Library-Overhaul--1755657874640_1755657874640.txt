- Project: UnitedGreenhouseGrowers
- Design Doc: "UGGA Resource Library Overhaul" (Doc ID: RLDD-v1)
- Invariants: (1) Keep existing auth system, (2) Maintain current routing structure, (3) A11y WCAG AA minimum, (4) No breaking changes to other pages, (5) Preserve existing blog functionality

[Goal]
Implement the Organizations tab (TB-07) with sections grouped by function, collapsible groups, and grid/list toggle within each section.

[Actions for Replit Agent]
1. Create `src/components/tabs/OrganizationsTab.jsx` with grouped layout
2. Define organization functions for grouping:
   - "Associations & Policy"
   - "Standards & Tools"
   - "Research & Education"
   - "Technology & Innovation"
   - "Market & Distribution"
3. Create `src/components/GroupedSection.jsx`:
   - Collapsible header with function name and count
   - Short description for each function (2-3 sentences)
   - aria-expanded attribute for accessibility
   - Smooth expand/collapse animation
   - Grid/list toggle within each section
4. Implement organization cards showing:
   - Organization name and logo (if available)
   - Primary function (as badge/tag)
   - Secondary tags for cross-functional areas
   - Headquarters location (city, state/country)
   - Website link with external icon
5. Add seed data for 20-30 organizations with structure:
   ```
   {
     type: 'organizations',
     title: 'Organization Name',
     data: {
       functions: ['Associations & Policy', 'Research & Education'],
       hq: {city: 'Washington', state: 'DC', country: 'USA'},
       urls: {site: 'https://...'},
       description: '...'
     }
   }
   ```
6. Connect to the data layer:
   - Use `useResources` hook with type='organizations'
   - Client-side grouping by primary function (first in array)
   - Maintain expanded/collapsed state in component state
7. Add organization-specific filters:
   - Function multi-select
   - Country/region filter
   - Alphabetical or relevance sort
8. Implement view persistence:
   - Remember grid/list preference per section in localStorage
   - Remember which sections are expanded/collapsed

[Checks & Tests]
- Navigate to Organizations tab and verify grouped display
- Test expand/collapse for each function group
- Toggle between grid and list view within a section
- Verify organization cards show all required information
- Test filters: select function and verify correct filtering
- Check keyboard navigation through sections
- Verify collapsed sections don't fetch unnecessary data
- Test with screen reader to ensure proper announcements
- Show me the rendered HTML structure for one expanded section

[Commit/PR]
Commit message: "feat: implement Organizations tab with grouped sections

- Add collapsible sections grouped by function
- Implement grid/list toggle per section
- Add organization cards with function tags
- Include filters for function and location"

[Stop Condition]
PASS: Organizations display in grouped sections, expand/collapse works, toggles persist
FAIL: If grouping fails, check data structure. If animations stutter, simplify transitions.
