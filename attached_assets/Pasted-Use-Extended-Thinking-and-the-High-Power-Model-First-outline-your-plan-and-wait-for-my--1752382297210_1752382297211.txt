GOAL – Update Sam Chronert’s Founding Member Bio
================================================================

Update the biography text for **Sam Chronert** on the **/about** page (https://www.greenhousegrowers.org/about), in the **Founding Members** section.

New bio copy:
> Sam began his work in indoor farming in a hands-on, entry-level role and steadily built his expertise through direct farm experience, close collaboration with peers, and learning from a lot of mistakes. Over time, he took on broader responsibilities across crop care, climate control, system commissioning, and yield improvement as a production Grower while simultaneously earning a Master’s in Agriculture from Washington State University along the way. Most of his practical know-how came from swapping ideas with growers, R&D scientists, university researchers, and vendors while troubleshooting real crop management problems in a large scale production farm. That habit of open collaboration led him to want to help create the United Greenhouse Growers Association — a straightforward space for production growers, academics, and industry partners to share data, compare methods, and solve problems together. His focus remains the same: keep learning, keep exchanging knowledge, and make day-to-day greenhouse work a little easier for everyone.
