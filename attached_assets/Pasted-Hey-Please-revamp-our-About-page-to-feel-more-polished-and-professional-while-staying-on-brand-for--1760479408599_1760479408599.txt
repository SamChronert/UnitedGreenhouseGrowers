Hey! Please revamp our About page to feel more polished and professional while staying on-brand for UGGA. Work within the current stack/styles (no heavy new deps). Tweak copy lightly only if needed for scannability.

Targets & Changes

Hero (top of About)

Add a simple visual hero (subtle greenhouse photo or abstract texture) with a clear page title + one-line subheading.

Increase top/bottom spacing so it feels like a real section header.

Mission

Keep the green “Our Mission” band but give it more breathing room (padding) and slightly larger type.

Make the line length shorter for better readability.

The Problem We’re Solving

Differentiate this visually from Mission (e.g., two-column layout: short blurb + supporting image/illustration).

Pull 2–3 key phrases into bold to aid scanning.

We’re Just Getting Started (highlight box)

Elevate this into a true highlight: soft accent background, subtle icon, and tighter copy.

Optionally show a simple roadmap/progress cue (Phase 1/2/3 labels—no complex logic).

Our Values

Keep the three principles, but use consistent icon cards with uniform sizing and spacing.

Trim text if needed so each card is ~3 short lines max.

Founding Members

Convert to clean profile cards: consistent circular headshots, name, title/role, 2–3 sentence bio.

Add a “Read more” link/modal if longer bios exist; keep the page scannable.

Ensure equal card widths/heights and predictable spacing.

How We’re Building UGGA Together (near page bottom)

Use a 3-across grid of action cards on desktop, single column on mobile (icons + bold verb headings + short blurbs).

Light green section background to separate from neighbors.

Color-emphasize the verbs in headings (Share, Give, Connect, Raise).

Calls-to-Action

Repeat a consistent CTA after 2–3 sections (e.g., “Join UGGA” / “Become a Member”).

Keep the final green CTA block, but ensure the earlier CTAs match its style.

Typography, Spacing, Color

Strengthen hierarchy: bigger H2s, consistent H3s, comfortable line-height, more white space between sections.

Alternate subtle background tints (white / light gray / pale green) to improve rhythm.

Keep iconography consistent with the “Built by growers” section.

Acceptance Checklist

Clear visual hierarchy from top → bottom; sections feel distinct.

Cards/grids look consistent on desktop and stack cleanly on mobile.

CTAs are visible in multiple places and use consistent styling.

Copy is succinct and scannable; key verbs/actions stand out in green.

No layout shifts or visual regressions on mobile.

Deliverables (please reply with):

A brief before/after summary per section (bullet list).

The list of files you touched and a short note on why.

Any new asset filenames/paths you added (images/icons).

Quick screenshots or preview links of the updated About page.

If anything is ambiguous, choose the simplest, clean implementation that matches the site’s current design system
