      description: "Sam began his work in indoor farming in a hands-on, entry-level role and steadily built his expertise through direct farm experience, close collaboration with peers, and learning from a lot of mistakes. Over time, he took on broader responsibilities across crop care, climate control, system commissioning, and yield improvement as a production Grower while earning a Master's in Agriculture from Washington State University along the way. Most of his practical know-how came from swapping ideas with growers, R&D scientists, university researchers, and vendors while troubleshooting real crop management problems in a large scale production farm. That habit of open collaboration led him to want to help create the United Greenhouse Growers Association - a straightforward space for production growers, academics, and industry partners to share data, compare methods, and solve problems together. His focus remains the same: keep learning, keep exchanging knowledge, and make day-to-day greenhouse work a little easier for everyone"

She's led plant science and R&D teams at organizations like Plenty and LumiGrow, and holds a Ph.D. in Plant Sciences from the University of California, Davis. Today, she runs Grow Big Consulting, where she helps Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) companies apply scientific insights to real-world production. Her motivation for co-founding the Greenhouse Growers Association is simple: empower growers with better access to plant science and industry knowledge. Melanie believes growers deserve a stronger voice in innovation, policy, and education â€” and she's committed to bridging that gap."

Over the past 14 years, he's worked with growers across North America through roles at companies like Signify, BIOS Lighting, and Heliospectra, helping them implement cutting-edge growing technology. He holds a degree in Business Administration from the University of Missouriâ€“St. Louis and currently leads GrowBig Consultants. Through the Greenhouse Growers Association, Neil hopes to support the industry that first sparked his passion â€” one where technology, food security, and sustainability converge. He believes everyone should have access to fresh, greenhouse-grown produce year-round, no matter where they live, and is driven to help make that a reality."
