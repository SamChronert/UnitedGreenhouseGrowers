# UGGA Platform - Replit Development Guide

## Overview
The United Greenhouse Growers Association (UGGA) is a nonprofit, grower-first network in its pilot phase, aiming to connect greenhouse growers nationwide, facilitate knowledge sharing, and amplify growers' voices in research and policy. The platform provides tools for grower networking, decision-making assistance, and a curated resource library, all co-designed with founding members based on direct grower feedback. The project's vision is to address fragmentation in the greenhouse industry by fostering community, providing practical solutions, and empowering growers.

## User Preferences
- Communication style: Friendly, conversational, plainspoken language that farmers relate to
- Tone: Warm, honest, non-corporate, grounded and helpful
- Avoid: Highlighting "AI" directly, flashy tech-forward language
